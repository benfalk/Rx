### Rx

  A list of scripts I find myself using from time to time that I was orginally
  keeping together in gists.

## setup.sh

From the terinmal you can run the following and it should set up your
environment similiar to mine.  It assumes you are running Ubuntu 15.04 or later
currently.  Feel free to comment out sections you don't want before running.

```
bash setup.sh
```
