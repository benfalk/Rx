# json_lines
#
# Simple little diddy that works somewhat like json_pp, but instead
# filters each line to json_pp seperately.  Good for reading logs where
# each line is seperately stored as json
#
# Example: cat /var/log/sytem.json.logs | json_lines

command -v json_pp >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo >&2 "json_pp is required"; exit 1; }
while read line
do
  echo "$line" | json_pp
done
